This project is for a particular customer to replace an ageing and unsupported MS Access database system.
Hence the name: **M**icrosoft **A**ccess **R**eplacement **S**ystem.  
The business scope includes Sales Quotations, Sales Orders and Purchase Orders. Documents can be emailed as PDFs and an event log and email history is maintained. Role based security is using a simple permissions model (from Ryan Bates) and Strong Parameters.  
The particular requirements of the client make this system unlikely to be of general application. The tests in particular are very suspect style-wise as I am still learning.
